* JDBC Pool - Yo-yo module

This is a module to start a JDBC connection pool in a Yo-yo
system, based on [[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/][Apache Commons DBCP2]].

** Dependency

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/yoyo.jdbc-pool "0.0.1"]
#+END_SRC

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [yoyo.jdbc-pool :refer [with-db-pool]])

  (with-db-pool {:driver "org.postgresql.Driver" ; optional - we'll guess it if you don't specify one!
                 :subprotocol "postgresql"
                 :host "..."
                 :port 5432
                 :username "..."
                 :password "..."
                 :db "..."
                 :max-total 8
                 :max-idle 8}
    (fn [db-pool]
      ...
      ))
#+END_SRC

This module is currently very basic and so only accepts the options
above - if you want to supply other options to the connection pool,
PRs are very gratefully received!
